Project Name: configCreator

Description: An attempt to build a basic tool for automatically creating csgo console commands to configure practice servers

The mvp will be for the user to select which features they want (e.g. via checkboxes) and the tool generating a string that the user can then manually copy and paste into their in-game console.
